# AoC2021

These are my attempts at Advent of Code for 2021.  I'm trying the new and exciting twinBasic (an independent replacement for VB6/VBA) and Nim.  I've also included VBA and Typescript if I have the time.

Unlike nim, I've had to write my own Library to make VBA (and hence twinBasic) more malleable so for the twin basic, day01 have the code for Day01 as well as the TwinLin64V2 (library)

Please feel free to take a look at my code and make any sugesstions to improve any of my misundertanding or reach more idiomatic Nim.
