# AoC2021

These are my attempts at Advent of Code for 2021.  I'm trying the new and exciting twinBasic (an independent replacement for VB6/VBA) and Nim.  I've also included VBA and Typescript if I have the time.

Unlike nim, I've had to write my own Library to make VBA (and hence twinBasic) more malleable This library can be found at

Please feel free to take a look at my code and make any sugesstions to improve any of my misundertandings or help me  reach more idiomatic Nim.

As twinBasic currently doesn't support external files you need to look here for the text files from the .project file
